## Study Overview
This study aims to replicate Stevens' Power Law for size perception.

## Hypotheses
We hypothesize that perceived size will follow a power function with an exponent different from 1.

Participants will compare squares of different sizes and judge which is larger.

## Analysis Plan
We will fit a power function to the data and examine the exponent.

## Sample Size
We aim to collect data from all workshop participants.
